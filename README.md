## Gear for Eclipse Day

### Glasses
You must have glasses that are `ISO 12312-2` certified. Buy them now, the price won't go down. Here are two options:

### Apps
There are two apps available for free, with an in-app purchase for a guided tour / push notifications for the 2024 eclipse.

 - [Solar Eclipse Timer](https://www.solareclipsetimer.com) is the defacto standard for Solar Eclipse Apps.
